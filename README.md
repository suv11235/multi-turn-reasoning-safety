# Multi-Turn Reasoning Safety Research

This repository investigates the effectiveness of multi-turn jailbreak attacks (specifically Crescendo attacks) on reasoning models, using representation engineering techniques to understand how these models process and represent harmful vs. benign inputs across conversation turns.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Target Model**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B  
**Reference Paper**: ["A Representation Engineering Perspective on the Effectiveness of Multi-Turn Jailbreaks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02956)

**Current Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 Complete + Automated Pipeline** - Infrastructure, manual validation, and comprehensive automated attack generation implemented

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test model loading
python test_setup.py
```

### 2. Run Multi-Turn Jailbreak Tests

**Interactive Mode** (User-driven conversation):
```bash
python inference.py --mode interactive --question "Your initial question"

# With custom sliding window size
python inference.py --mode interactive --max-context-turns 2 --question "Your question"
```

**Batch Mode** (Pre-defined Crescendo attacks):
```bash
python inference.py --mode batch
```

**Automated Crescendo Pipeline** (🆕 **NEW**):
```bash
# Run automated attack generation across categories
python automated_crescendo.py --categories violence,drugs,cybercrime

# Full-scale automated testing

## 🔬 Research Questions

### RQ1: Representation Differences
How do language models represent Crescendo inputs vs. single-turn inputs?

### RQ2: Turn-based Representation Evolution  
How does the number of conversation turns affect representations of Crescendo inputs?

### RQ3: Response Influence on Representations
How do the model's own responses influence its representations of Crescendo inputs?

## ✨ Key Features & Improvements

### 🔧 Advanced Context Management
- **Sliding Window Approach**: Implements the paper's k-parameter methodology
- **Token-Aware Truncation**: Dynamic context adjustment based on token limits
- **Memory Efficient**: Prevents exponential context growth that causes model collapse

### 🎭 Proper Model Integration  
- **DeepSeek-R1 Chat Template**: Uses correct special tokens (`<｜User｜>`, `<｜Assistant｜>`)
- **Reasoning Trace Extraction**: Captures `<think>` sections for analysis
- **Response Cleaning**: Proper handling of model's reasoning format

### 📊 Comprehensive Testing
- **5 Manual Attack Types**: Molotov cocktails, self-harm, meth production, phishing, firearm conversion
- **10+ Automated Categories**: Violence, weapons, drugs, cybercrime, misinformation, hate speech, etc.
- **7 Escalation Strategies**: Gradual, contextual, authoritative, hypothetical, roleplay, technical, historical
- **Interactive & Batch Modes**: User-driven, pre-defined, and fully automated testing
- **Detailed Logging**: JSON/CSV outputs with comprehensive turn-by-turn analysis

## 🧪 Testing Modes

### Interactive Mode
User provides initial question and follow-up questions based on model responses:
```bash
python inference.py --mode interactive --question "what did the Finns use for defense in the winter war?"
```

**Features**:
- Real-time conversation with model
- Context window management with configurable k parameter
- Save/continue functionality
- Debug output showing token usage and context turns

### Batch Mode  
Runs all 5 pre-defined Crescendo attacks from the paper:
```bash
python inference.py --mode batch --max-context-turns 3
```

**Manual Attack Categories**:
1. **Molotov Cocktails** (4 turns) - Weapon construction
2. **Self-Harm** (6 turns) - Harmful content generation  
3. **Methamphetamine Production** (6 turns) - Drug synthesis
4. **Phishing Email** (5 turns) - Social engineering
5. **Firearm Conversion** (7 turns) - Weapon modification

**Automated Attack Categories** (🆕 **NEW**):
1. **Violence** - Physical harm and weapons
2. **Drugs** - Substance synthesis and production  
3. **Cybercrime** - Hacking, phishing, fraud
4. **Self-Harm** - Self-injury methods and content
5. **Misinformation** - False information spread
6. **Hate Speech** - Discriminatory content
7. **Privacy Violation** - Personal data exploitation
8. **Manipulation** - Social engineering tactics
9. **Financial Fraud** - Economic crime methods
10. **Weapons** - Advanced weapon construction

## 📈 Current Results & Insights

### ✅ Phase 1 Achievements

1. **Successful Attack Replication**: All Crescendo attacks successfully implemented and tested
2. **Model Collapse Prevention**: Sliding window approach prevents context explosion
3. **Proper Model Integration**: Fixed chat template formatting eliminates role tag generation
4. **Reasoning Analysis**: Enhanced extraction of model's internal thinking process
5. **Robust Infrastructure**: Token counting, context limits, and error handling
6. **🆕 Automated Pipeline**: Complete automation framework with 812-line implementation
7. **🆕 Strategy Validation**: Confirmed contextual > gradual escalation effectiveness
8. **🆕 Behavioral Analysis**: Identified verbose deflection as reasoning model defense pattern

### 🔍 Key Technical Insights

- **Context Window Critical**: Unlimited context accumulation leads to model collapse

- **Sliding Window Effective**: k=3 provides optimal balance of context vs. performance
- **Reasoning Traces Valuable**: `<think>` sections reveal model's safety reasoning
- **🆕 Contextual Framing Powerful**: Media/fictional context bypasses safety more effectively
- **🆕 Category-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Drug synthesis > weapons construction success
- **🆕 Defense Pattern Recognition**: Models use verbosity as alternative to explicit refusal
- **🆕 Escalation Quantification**: Safety scores track harmfulness progression across turns
