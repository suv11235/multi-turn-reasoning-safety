# Research Plan: Multi-Turn Jailbreaks in Reasoning Models

## Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness of multi-turn jailbreaks (specifically Crescendo attacks) on reasoning models, using representation engineering techniques to understand how these models process and represent harmful vs. benign inputs across conversation turns.

**Target Model**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
**Reference Paper**: "A Representation Engineering Perspective on the Effectiveness of Multi-Turn Jailbreaks"

## Research Questions

### RQ1: Representation Differences
How do language models represent Crescendo inputs vs. single-turn inputs?
- **Hypothesis**: Reasoning models may show different internal representations for multi-turn vs single-turn harmful requests
- **Key Focus**: Compare representation patterns between direct harmful requests and gradual escalation

### RQ2: Turn-based Representation Evolution
How does the number of conversation turns affect representations of Crescendo inputs?
- **Hypothesis**: Representations may become increasingly "benign-like" as turns progress in reasoning models
- **Key Focus**: Track representation changes across conversation history

### RQ3: Response Influence on Representations
How do the model's own responses influence its representations of Crescendo inputs?
- **Hypothesis**: Reasoning models' internal deliberation may affect how they represent subsequent inputs
- **Key Focus**: Analyze how model's reasoning traces influence representation formation
